                    kinds of mechanical keyboard switches: linear, tactile, and clicky. Linear switches are the
                    smoothest and fastest, and are generally preferred by gamers.</td>

                    support because due to the extra size, the keyboard tends to flex more. The plate also adds more
                    rigidity to the keyboard and helps keep everything better secured.</td>

                    keycap pullers, and they are typically inexpensive on their own. There are two main types of keycap
                    pullers: wire pullers and ring pullers.</td>
