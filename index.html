        <h2>40% keyboard</h2>
        <p>
            40% keyboards are a niche keyboard, its keyboard layout does away with the number row, arrow cluster, and
            often punctuation keys. People who prefer 40% keyboards have optimized their use of space and movement, a
            40% keyboard can type and game very efficiently once you get used to its nuances

            <h2>60% keyboard</h2>
            <p>
                A 60% keyboard does away with all function keys, arrow keys and numpad, leaving a much smaller footprint
                horizontally and vertically. The keys that are not present physically on the 60% layout are usually
                accessible through a function layer. For example, most 60% keyboards have the F1 key under fn+1.

            <p>
                A 65% keyboard has roughly 65% of the keys a full-sized keyboard has, with a full-size keyboard with a
                US layout containing 104 keys including a number pad which many cannot live without, while a 65% will
                usually have 67 or 68 keys depending on the manufacturer.

                75% is the common name given to keyboards that have a compact layout, roughly 70 to 75% of the width of
                a full-size keyboard, but retain the F key row at the top.

                A TKL keyboard refers to a keyboard without the numpad, or the number keys typically found to the right
                of the alphanumeric keys at the center. While many players are used to full-sized keyboards, more and
                more are shifting their preferences toward TKL keyboards for a number of reasons.
